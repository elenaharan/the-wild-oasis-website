# Developer's notes

This project is built with ``Next.js App router`` which is the modern and recommended way of building Next.js applications, as opposed to ``pages router``. <br />

This new recommended way was introduced in 2023 in Next version ``13.4``. 
Developing this application with ``Next.js App router`` would also help to explore ``React full-stack architecture`` such as server components, server actions, steaming, parallel routing, intercepting routes, etc.
