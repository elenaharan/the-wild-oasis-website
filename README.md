# Developer's notes

This project is built with ``Next.js App router`` which is the modern and recommended way of building Next.js applications, as opposed to ``pages router``. <br />

This new recommended way was introduced in 2023 in Next version ``13.4``. 
Developing this application with ``Next.js App router`` would also help to explore ``React full-stack architecture`` such as server components, server actions, steaming, parallel routing, intercepting routes, etc. 

<b>The Next.js documentation:</b>

<b>To update this project to the latest Next.js version, run the following command in the project folder:</b><br />
``npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest``
